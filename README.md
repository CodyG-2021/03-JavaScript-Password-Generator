# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Random Password Generator

The goal of this site is to allow a user to create a secure password.

The user will be prompted for criteria for a custom password of their choice such as length of the password, and what characters they would like to see within the password.

A note from Cody:

*JS is why I joined this bootcamp. I feel like its the foundation I really need to lay the foundation that connects it all. This was a good challenge, but I feel the next assignment will be harder.*
